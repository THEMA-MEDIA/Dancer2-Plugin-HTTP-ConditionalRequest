=head1 SYNOPSIS

Conditionally handling HTTP request based on eTag or Modification-Date,
according to RFC 7232

HTTP Conditional Requests are used for telling servers that they only have to
perform the method if the preconditions are met. Such requests are either used
by caches to (re)validate the cached response with the origin server - or -
to prevent lost-updates with unsafe-methods in a stateless api (like REST).

        ...
        my $object = find_something(param->{id})
            or return sub { status (404 ) };
        
        ...

=head1 RFC_7232 HTTP: Conditional Requests... explained

As mentioned in the previous section, Conditional Requests are for two purposes
mainly:

=head2 Caching

For GET and HEAD methods, the caching-server passes the validators to the origin
server to see if it can still use the cached version or not - and if not, get a
fresh version.

Keep in mind that the Dancer2 server is probably designed to be that originating
server and should provide either the 304 (Not Modified) status or a fresh
representation off the requested resource. At this stage (and in compliance with
the RFC) there is nothing to deal with the caching of the responses at all.

This plugin does not do any caching, it's only purpose is to respond correctly
to conditional requests. Neither does this plugin set any caching-directives
that are part of RFC_7234 (Caching), and for which there is a seperate plugin.

=head2 Lost-Updates

For REST api's it is important to understand that it is a Stateless interface.
This means that there is no such thing as record locking on the server. Would
one desire to edit a resource, the only way to check that one is not accidently
overwritin someone elses changes, is comparing it with weak or strong
validators, like date/time of a last modification - or a unique version
identifier, known as a eTag.

=head2 Strong and weak validators

ETags are stronger validators than the Date Last-Modified. In the above
described example, it has two validators provided that can be used to check the
conditional request. If the client did set an eTag conditional in 'If-Matched'
or 'If-None-Matched', it will try to match that. If not, it will try to match
against the Date Last-Modified with either the 'If-Modified-Since' or
'If-Unmodified-Since'.

=head2 Required or not

The optional 'http_strict' turns the API into a strict mode. Running under
'strict' ensures that the client will provided either the eTag or Date-Modified
validator for un-safe requests. If not provided when required, it will return a
response with status 428 (Precondition Required) (RFC 6585).

When set to false, it allows a client to sent of a request without the headers
for the conditional requests and as such have bypassed all the checks end up in
the last validation step and continue with the requested operation.

=head2 Safe and unsafe methods

Sending these validators with a GET request is used for caching and respond with
a status of 304 (Not Modified) when the client has a 'fresh' version. Remember
though to send of current caching-information too (according to the RFC 7232).

When used with 'unsafe' methods that will cause updates, these validators can
prevent 'lost updates' and will respond with 412 (Precondition Failed) when
there might have happened an intermediate update.

=head2 Generating eTags and Dates Last-Modified

Unfortunately, for a any method one might have to retrieve and process the
resource data before being capable of generating a eTag. Or one might have to go
through a few pieces of underlying data structures to find that
last-modification date.

For a GET method one can then skip the 'post-processing' like serialisation and
one does no longer have to send the data but only the status message 304
(Not Modified).

=head2 More reading

There is a lot of additional information in RFC-7232 about generating and
retrieving eTags or last-modification-dates. Please read-up in the RFC about
those topics.

=head1 Dancer2 Keywords

=head2 http_conditional

This keyword takes as last argument the CODEREF of the part that should be ran
if the pre-conditions are met.

A optional hashref takes the options

=over

=item etag

a string that 'uniquely' identifies the current version of the resource.

=item last_modified

a HTTP Date compliant string of the date/time this resource was last updated.

A suitable string can be created from a UNIX timestamp using
L<HTTP::Date::time2str|HTTP::Date/time2str>, or from a L<DateTime|DateTime>
object using C<format_datetime> from L<DateTime::Format::HTTP|DateTime::Format::HTTP/format_datetime>.

=item http_strict

if set to true, it enforces clients that request an unsafe method to provide one
or both validators.

=back

If used with either a GET or a HEAD method, the validators mentioned in the
options are returned in the appropriate HTTP Header Fields.
